RECURSIVE FERRIS WHEEL

Luke Lovett

The user controls include a parameter "recursive depth" that allows you to
control how many "ferris wheels within the ferris wheels" there are.  The
maximum value for this is 5, but I wouldn't recommend going that far; I think
the lab iMacs wanted to cry at around 3. The effect is definitely a lot better
when you also increase the "rotation speed" parameter along with the recursive
depth.

I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.
